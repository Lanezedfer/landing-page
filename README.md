[__landing-page__](https://Lanezedfer.github.io/landing-page/) is an extremely simple project developed as part of [__The Odin Project Foundations Course__](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations). This personal project was an endeavor to review and strengthen my proficiency in the basics and fundamentals of HTML5 and CSS3, primarily in terms of concise structuring, readability, and maintainability.
